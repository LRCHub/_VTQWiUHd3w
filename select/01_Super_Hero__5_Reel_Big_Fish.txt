She was...
Caught up on some scaffold high
I took chances with my life
Shot up and I made her safe
Tucked her in my super cape
I am super hero number five.

She was...
Lois Lane subtitute
We made love and electrocute
Gave her the history of my life
Begged her that she be my wife
I am super hero number five

She was...
Picture perfect ball and chain
She was pulling back the reigns
Took my cape and my blue suit
Went to find a new young cutie
I am super hero number five
